<h3>Welcome to my Project Manager!</h3>

<h4>What is it?</h4>

This web application is meant as a basic project managering tool. In theory it could be used by for example a teacher to manage groups of students doing different kinds of projects within a course.

You can freely try the app in Heroku using the following link:
https://projectmanagereemeli.herokuapp.com/ (Be patient! It is a slow one)

**********************************************************************

### You can test admin user functionalities of the app with the following login details:

Username: Eemelinen

Password: admin

* Don't worry! Only imaginary personal details in the app. *

Or you can register as a new user.

## Known bugs:

- When registering to the application as a new user you might get an error message. In this case just navigate back to the main page.

- When logging in you sometimes receive an error message. Just navigate back to the main page, and you should show as logged in.
