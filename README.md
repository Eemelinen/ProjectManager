##Welcome to my Project Manager!

##What is it?
This web application is meant as a basic project managering tool. In theory it could be used by for example a teacher to manage groups of students doing different kinds of projects within a course.

With Admin rights teacher could for example:
1. Create new projects
2. Give students who have joined a particular project tasks.
3. Change tasks
4. Remove students from projects
5. See the list of all students, plus their contact information and the projects they have joined

You can also register to the app as a normal user. (Lets stick to our roles and say that you are a student)
As a student user you can:
1. Sign up to the site
2. Join projects
3. See the member pages of other student's who have joined the projects.

As a regular user you cant:
1. See all all the people who have signed up to the site.
2. Modify project or user details.

This project was done as a part of server programming course of Haaga-Helia.
